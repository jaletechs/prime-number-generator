Prime Number Generator is a Command-Line application for generating prime numbers using a number of generation strategies.
e.g. Brute Force (with and without optimizations), and Sieve of Eratosthenes.

## Requirements
This project is built with Gradle 4.4.1 and Java 1.8

## Execution
The project is a gradle project, hence execution would require running a few gradle tasks. e.g.

```bash
gradle run
```
To run the project with as little console logs as possible (plain mode), run with the following command
```bash
gradle --console plain run
```
To run tests
```bash
gradle test
```
Depending on your preferred IDE, you can run both and project and tests with a simple button click :)
